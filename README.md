This is my first attempt at a project that instructs me to create a web design while using figma.
PLEASE READ...
Heres how to navigate this completed web design:
Click on the library logo in order to go to the main page.
Click on About Us on the top nav to learn more about the library.
Click on the sign in button to go to the registeration page.
From the sign in page type in your name and click the register button to go to the profile page.
On the side nav click on Catalog to view the book selection.
On the side nav click on E-book to get an E-book's description. 
Go back home by clicking the main logo once again.
Thanks for visiting! :)
